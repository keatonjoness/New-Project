    <h1>Welcome To My Website </h1>

    <p>
        My name is Keaton Jones. I'm 21 years old.
        I am new to coding and web development. <br>
        I attended SEMO for college back in 2018-2019.
        My major was Cyber-Security, which was back. <br>
        On December I came back home and went to Southwest,
        but I took a year off through 2020 due to COVID. <br>
        While taking that year off I took the time to
        pursue Photography. I plan on going back to Southwest <br>
        for one more semester and then I'll go to the UofM or TSU. <br>
        If I go to the UofM then I will likely run track for Memphis.
        Running track will help me pay for school. <br>
        Instead of majoring in Cyber-Security <br>
        i'll change my major to Computer-Science.
    </p>
